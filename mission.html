                    <h2>Geneva Soccer League Mission Statement</h2>
                    <p>Our mission is to promote, teach, and enjoy the game of soccer. Through soccer, young athletes
                        not only learn individual skills, they learn the importance of teamwork and accountability.</p>

                    <p>Soccer demands physical strength and endurance while also requiring teamwork, calculation, and
                        creativity. We believe that developing these skills empowers our young athletes on and off the
                        field.</p>

                    <p>Geneva Soccer is a nonprofit organization that is dedicated to creating a safe, fun, and positive
                        soccer culture.</p>
