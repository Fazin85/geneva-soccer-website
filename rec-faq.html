                    <h3>What equipment will I need to buy?</h3>
                    <p>The only equipment that is required are shin guards and water bottle. Most children like to bring
                        their own ball to practice, and we encourage them to do so.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>What size ball do I need?</h3>
                    <p>For practice, children can use any size ball. For games:</p>
                    <p>Under 6: Size 3</p>
                    <p>Under 10 and Under 8: Size 4</p>

                    <p>Teams practice 1-2 times per week at a time set by the coach. Generally practices begin at 5, 6
                        or 7 p.m. on weeknights. If you would like to set the practice schedule, we encourage you to
                        volunteer to coach!</p>

                    <h3>Do you need volunteers to help coach?</h3>
                    <p>We can always use volunteers! When you register your child, please sign yourself up to volunteer
                        if you are interested and able.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Are there requirements to coach?</h3>
                    <p>All coaches will undergo a background check and be asked to complete an online safety training
                        course that takes ~1 hour to complete.</p>

                    <p>You will be expected to schedule and lead 2 practices a week. As coach, you can set the schedule.
                    </p>
                    <p>You will receive a team roster and need to call all parents of your players.</p>
                    <p>On game days, you will coach the team, do substitutions and ensure kids have fun and abide by the
                        rules.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Is there any help available for coaches?</h3>
                    <p>We will conduct a coaches training at the beginning of the season to show a few age-appropriate
                        drills to best teach fundamentals and conduct effective practices.</p>
                    <p>In addition, our soccer board has many experienced rec and travel coaches who would be happy to
                        offer advice and guidance.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>What age groups are available?</h3>
                    <p>Our recreational program typically serves players ages 4-13, though divisions may vary by season
                        depending on registration numbers. All skill levels are welcome, and we focus on fun and
                        fundamental skill development.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Is recreational soccer competitive?</h3>
                    <p>Our recreational program emphasizes fun, skill development, and equal playing time rather than
                        competition. While we keep score during games, the focus is on learning and enjoying the sport
                        in a supportive environment.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>How are teams formed?</h3>
                    <p>Teams are typically formed based on age groups and balanced to ensure fair play. We aim to create
                        teams that allow all players to participate equally and develop their skills throughout the
                        season.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>What if my child has never played soccer before?</h3>

                        skills and rules in a fun, non-intimidating environment. No prior experience is necessary.</p>

                    <p>Games cancelled due to weather conditions may be rescheduled when possible. However, due to field
                        availability and scheduling constraints, not all cancelled games can be made up.</p>

                    <h3>Can parents help during practices and games?</h3>
                    <p>Parent involvement is always welcome! You can help by volunteering as an assistant coach, helping
                        with team management, or simply cheering on all the players during games.</p>
